We're getting bigger everyday
Bigger everyday
We're getting bigger everyday
Bigger everyday
No limitations (No limitations)
We've taken over (We've taken over)
We're getting bigger everyday

When we step in the arena
Is a banger
Silence the voice of failure
We make success louder, oh
Bigger and bigger, we're bigger
And it's realer than real
And we are on fire
And this is the life that we choose
We balling in the Holy Ghost
Higher we go
We will never stop, oh

There's a Spirit that's alive in me
The Spirit of the Lord
And it's taking me to levels
We have never been before
I gat joy like a river
Chopping life like a pizza
'Cause I'm bigger, bigger
I'm bigger, bigger, bigger, yeah
